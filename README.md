# Intermediate JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

In this Password Generator challenge will  create a Password Generator application that allows users to generate a secure password based on their preferences. The application will present a series of prompts for password criteria, including length and character types. The user's input will be used to generate a random password that meets their selected criteria.

## Installation

. Clone the repository or download the project files.

. Open the project directory in your preferred console or code editor.
    
## Requirements

### Password Criteria

- The password length should be at least 8 characters but no more than 128 characters.
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Numeric digits (0-9)
- Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.)


## Usage/Examples

. Open your console and navigate to the project directory.

. Run the index.html file or execute the index.js file using a JavaScript runtime environment.

. Here's an example of how the application might look like when implemented:

## Lessons Learned

- How to implementing user input validation is crucial to ensure that the user provides valid data and meets the required criteria. Proper validation helps prevent unexpected behavior and improves the overall user experience.

- learned about utilizing arrays to store and manage data, such as the character types for the password, is essential. Array manipulation methods like `concat` and accessing random elements help create diverse and secure passwords.

- Understanding event handling and adding event listeners to buttons or other elements allows us to trigger actions when certain events occur, such as generating a password when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button.

- Breaking down the application's functionality into smaller, reusable functions helps improve code readability, maintainability, and encourages the use of good programming practices.
